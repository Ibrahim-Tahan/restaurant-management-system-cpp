When done the meals are stored in a text file and the prices on a separate text file.

After finishing his order, the full price is displayed. A feature that was added to the program is that, if the price is above 300000 LBP the restaurant offers a 10% discount. A second feature is a random number generator, where the costumer can pay 10000 LBP to guess a number between 1 and 10, and if the number is correct, the order is free of charge.
